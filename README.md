# The_CUBIES_Game_Project
This repository houses all versions of CUBIES: A 2D Mobile Game along with their complete source code.

1. **CUBIES A 2D Mobile Game** is Version 1.1b (Original) which is created between December 2006 to March 2007. It was run, compiled, and tested multiple times across all proponent's Desktop PC from initial Game to its finished product using Sun Java Wireless Toolkit.  
* The source code (using Notepad++) was created by Ronald Dee and Argel Castillo.
* The design layout (using Adobe Photoshop CS2) and sound effects (using Sony SoundForge) were implemented by Vincent Paranpan.
* Part of the Thesis Documentation was done by Warren Azarcon.

2. **CUBIES II (Version 1.2)** is the Alternative version of the Original which is created in the last few days of the CUBIES Project between February 2007 to March 2007 using the same tools as the Original version. It runs in a smaller screen compared to Version 1.1b (Original). It was initiated by Vincent Paranpan and was also completed on his Desktop PC.

3. **CUBIES III (Version 1.3)** is the Neo version of the Original which was planned by Ronald Dee on 2014 but was fully implemented in 2020. It was actually a forked version of Version 1.1b (Original). It was completed via Guest VM CubiesI-Reboot which runs Windows 8.1 (32-bit) OS using Oracle VM VirtualBox on its Main Host CUBIES II PC with Windows 10 OS.
